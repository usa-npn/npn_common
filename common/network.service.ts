TODO
What this service is doing is very boiler plate and should be consolidated in a shared injectable service.
I.e.
Many service inject Http/CacheService/NpnConfiguration and then contain logic very very similar to
what is done in getNetworks.  These three injectables should be wrapped up in a common service class
that avoids everyone needing to inject those three things (I.e. exposes Http/CacheService/NpnConfiguration as public members)
and contains utility functions ala ClippedWmsMapSelection.cachedGet in which case getStations becomes just a few lines.
